# pyhms
The pyhms is a public project to develope the US Army Corps of Engineers's Hydrologic Engineering Center - Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) model in Python language. The main idea is to deliver many benefits to academic communities, including enhancing/changing original theories (equations), applying new types of data, and incorporating with other models.

All source codes are written based on textbooks, articles, and HEC-HMS manuals. Currently, only limited methodologies are available.

The project is still a work in progress. If anyone is interested, feel free to contribute or contact to me (Donghoon Lee , dlee298@wisc.edu).
